### Keyboard Test:

To test your keyboard, open the "Keyboard Test" window and press every key on your keyboard. The app will tell you what key is being pressed by changing its color to green.

Note that some system keys such as media buttons can't be tested. But you can test the functions keys though by holding the 'Fn' key and then pressing a function key.

### Dead Pixel Test:

Dead pixels are defective pixels that are not performing as expected. Variations of dead pixels are dark dot, bright dot, and partial sub-pixel defects.

Clean the screen gently with a soft cloth and click "Dead Pixel Test". Press left & right arrow keys to change screen color. Press the 'Esc' button when you're done to close the test window.
